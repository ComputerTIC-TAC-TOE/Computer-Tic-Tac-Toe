# Computer-Tic-Tac-Toe

Story -

This is a game of tic-tac-toe in which you can play with a friend or against a computer opponent.  
In this futuristic apocalyptic game that pits you against the hand of fate. This game is a labor
of love. In a way, the very concept of it is truly wonderful. Knowing that at any moment the world
can end. Knowing that even in the depth's of space all can end in a blink of an eye. That's why
"Computer Tic-Tac-Toe" is the way it is. It's meant to draw you in, it's meant to give you the 
feeling of dread, it's meant to show the hopelessness of one's own existence. When the game starts
the story already tells you that your dead and when you close the game you basically kill the main
character of the game. That's why it's such a neat idea. 

Rules - 

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You can either play as X or O. With a
friend or with the "Ships Computer". The first player to get 3 in a row either "Up, Down, Across,
or Diagonally will be delcared the winner. When all 9 squares are filled the game is over.
