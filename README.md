# Computer-Tic-Tac-Toe

Story -

You are alone. Drifting through space. Your ship is losing power and you are waiting to die. With 
only a few hours left, you decide to boot up the old games computer and figure why not spend your 
few remaining moments.

About -

This is a game of tic-tac-toe in which you can play with a friend or against a computer opponent.  
In this futuristic apocalyptic game that pits you against the hand of fate. This game is a labor
of love. In a way, the very concept of it is truly wonderful. Knowing that at any moment the world
can end. Knowing that even in the depths of space all can end in a blink of an eye. That's why
"Computer Tic-Tac-Toe" is the way it is. It's meant to draw you in, it's meant to give you the 
feeling of dread, it's meant to show the hopelessness of one's own existence. When the game starts
the story already tells you that your dead and when you close the game you basically kill the main
character of the game. That's why it's such a neat idea. 

Rules - 

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You can either play as X or O. With a
friend or with the "Ships Computer". The first player to get 3 in a row either "Up, Down, Across,
or Diagonally will be declared the winner. When all 9 squares are filled the game is over.

Why -

Now, the main reason to why I did this is because I honestly do enjoy the idea of a simple game of
tic-tac-toe set in space. Set on a ship floating in space. I've been documenting my progress in
playing this game and I must say that it's been a pretty fun trip. I am planning on expanding the
story in the game and to continue showing off my work.
